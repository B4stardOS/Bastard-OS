`A Custom Version of Onion OS for the Miyoo Mini`

**Do you have a spare SD card?** 

**Do you like the stock Miyoo Mini firmware but don't like how it runs?** 

**Do you love Onion and Mini UI for their own unique reasons?** 

Bastard OS is a amalgamation of the stock OS and Onion OS taking what I like from both and smashin em together.

* Modified `MainUIBatPerc` and it now supports reporting battery at 10% increments instead of 20%

* Modified `chargingState` to suport 10 frames instead of 6

* System dialogue has been completely revamped! The boring translated dialogue has been updated to not only be more accurate but also explain things better. Personally this change was soooooo needed and I cant believe it hasn't been adjusted on the main FW.

* Brand new GLITCHED theme by `Syphen` to make the device feel like new and includes selected icons on the main screen and on the consoles.

* Using the Miyoo made `ra32.ss` but baked into Onion OS for faster boot times, better performance and battery life vs StockOS.

* Keeps original in-game menu button action with QUICK MENU but fully themed.

* Onion Installer used to install RetroArch shortcuts for easy, onion style access to games. Use The Bastard Installer to add or remove shortcuts.

* Quick save via power button enabled. Press power button in game (except PS*) and the system will quicksave and shutdown. *Power back on and select your game in recent to resume!* *For PS quicksave functions use the RetroArch shortcut for PS and use the button combo `MENU + POWER` to quicksave and powerdown!

* Faster then stock with cores picked by my personal experience.

* BASTARD MODIFIED Custom Keymon fully working by `Eggs` <3 RTC and Screenshot built in! (check shortcuts)

* Onion OS v3.11.2 base, built on SDL audio.

* includes `Eggs` full miyoo mini optimized RetroArch to run systems not included. Found in Apps.

* **No** background music on the homescreen.

* Play activity by Onion to teack gameplay.

* Includes File Explorer and Thank you apps.

* Includes 240pTestSuite or alternative test rom for systems except arcade.
