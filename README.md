# Bastard OS
`A Custom Version of Onion OS for the Miyoo Mini`

**Do you have a spare SD card?** 

**Do you like the stock Miyoo Mini firmware but don't like how it runs?** 

**Do you love Onion and Mini UI for their own unique reasons?** 

Bastard OS is a amalgamation of the stock OS and Onion OS taking what I like from both and smashin em together.

# Features:

* Using the Miyoo made `ra32.ss` but baked into Onion OS for faster boot times, better performance and battery life.

* Keeps original in-game menu button action with QUICK MENU but fully themed.

* Onion Installer used to install RetroArch shortcuts for easy, onion style access to games. Use The Bastard Installer to add or remove shortcuts.

* Quick save via power button enabled. Press power button in game (except PS*) and the system will quicksave and shutdown. *Power back on and select your game in recent to resume!* *For PS quicksave functions use the RetroArch shortcut for PS and use the button combo `MENU + POWER` to quicksave and powerdown!

* Faster then stock with cores picked by my personal experience.

* Custom Keymon fully working by `Eggs` <3 RTC and Screenshot built in! (check shortcuts)

* Onion OS v3.11.2 base, built on SDL audio.

* includes `Eggs` full miyoo mini optimized RetroArch to run systems not included. Found in Apps.

* **No** background music on the homescreen.

* Play activity by Onion to teack gameplay.

* Includes File Explorer, Thank you app and Shutdown shortcut in Apps.

ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR GAMES AND SAVES/STATES. RECCOMENDED USING THIS ON AN EXTRA CARD AS ITS MAINLY FOR PERSONAL USE.

1. `Delete all partitions of your SD card and format to Fat32`
2. `Copy the contents of "Bastard OS SD Files" to your fresh SD` 
3. `Instert SD to Miyoo Mini and turn on`
4. `Go through the installer. All EMUs will install AUTOMATICALLY`
5. `If you want to install any Retroarch shortcuts then select them in the installer`
3. `The mini will shutdown and you are all done!`

# Shortcuts:

Shortcuts via `Eggs`:

*START button:* Adjust the brightness by pressing L2/R2 while holding down.

*SELECT button:* Adjust the internal digital volume by pressing L2/R2 while holding down. (-30dB \~ +30dB, 3dB step) Pressing SELECT + L2 + R2 to reset to 0dB. - Digital volume setting value is not saved and will be restored if the application initializes - Because of the analog wheel, this feature is not likely to be used very often, but it may be useful if sound is too loud or too quiet.

*During suspend - MENU button:* Take a screenshot. a png file will be saved in /Screenshots in SD. (Same function as scrshot app)

*During suspend - START button:* Adjust internal clock. (Same function as clock daemon) Clock setting is saved as currentTime.txt in the same directory as keymon. - Note that some applications may have problems if the time is changed during execution.

*During suspend - SELECT button:* Adjust LCD parameters. (Luma / Hue / Saturation / Contrast) - No need to reboot after adjustment.

*Power button ingame (EXCEPT PSX):* Pressing in all emus BUT PSX will auto-save and shutdown. When powering on you can open the save state by going into recents or finding game file
